> OpenMAMS aggregates distributed UAV memories for long-horizon question answering. Our memory-centric framework measures what each candidate memory adds, then jointly selects UAVs and allocates transmit power under communication constraints.



## Overview

OpenMAMS is the multi-agent memory system and benchmarking platform developed for **low-altitude question answering (LAQA)**. It connects aerial observations with a ground memory server so that users can ask about objects, locations, and events observed over time.

The platform described in the paper supports:

- **Multi-agent data collection:** perspective images, timestamps, 6D poses, and LiDAR point clouds in CARLA.
- **Panoramic multi-agent system:** 360° image and video capture across multiple UAVs, with rectified FPV views and VLM-generated captions.
- **Memory construction and retrieval:** VLM captioning, text embeddings, and a vector database for spatiotemporal queries.
- **Memory quality evaluation:** a generative adversarial exam (GAE) measures the knowledge gap between candidate observations and the current memory.
- **Memory-centric resource allocation:** MemCen jointly selects UAV memories and allocates transmit power, with penalty successive optimization (PSO) and learning to memorize (L2M) solvers.

## Architecture

![LAQA architecture: distributed UAV observations are uploaded to a ground server for memory construction and question answering.](assets/architecture.png)

Selected observations are captioned and stored with their timestamps and poses. The resulting global memory supports retrieval-augmented question answering.

<summary><strong>How does GAE evaluate a candidate memory?</strong></summary>

![GAE pipeline with pilot upload, exam generation, and practice testing against the current memory.](assets/generative-adversarial-exam.png)

GAE generates questions grounded in candidate observations and tests whether the current global memory can answer them. Unanswered questions reveal missing knowledge and quantify the value of acquiring that candidate memory. MemCen combines this task utility with payload sizes, channel conditions, interference, and power constraints.

## CARLA Simulation

### Town04: multi-UAV inspection

[![CARLA Town04 ten-UAV demo showing UAV locations, image frames, and their associated captions.](assets/carla-town04.png)](assets/carla-town04.png)

Ten UAVs inspect different regions of Town04 and collect complementary observations for memory construction. The demo shows their locations, sample image frames, and associated captions. Questions ask whether an object is present, where it is located, and which UAV observed it.

### Town05: dynamic and heterogeneous UAVs

</tr>
</table>

Four fixed-wing and six multirotor UAVs conduct a 200-second search-and-rescue mission in Town05. Their trajectories, image workloads, and building blockage create varying communication conditions. MemCen selects complementary memories and adapts transmit power to support downstream question answering.

## Real-World Experiments

### Panoramic multi-agent system (PMAS)

[![PMAS field experiment: three-UAV inspection team, COLMAP point cloud and trajectories, scene graphs, and captioned images with question-answering examples.](assets/pmas-real-demo.webp)](assets/pmas-real-demo.png)

Three panoramic UAVs collect complementary observations along distinct routes. Their observations are registered in a shared 3D coordinate frame for object-presence and spatial-grounding questions. The aerial data are collected in the field, while communication is evaluated through offline channel replay.

### UAV-to-ground-robot memory reuse

A robot dog reuses aerial memory to answer environmental questions and navigate to a queried location.

## Memory-Native Non-Terrestrial Networks

MemNTN extends memory-based remote question answering to satellite networks through memory management, fusion, and valuation.

![MemNTN evaluation results: LEOPath and CARLA setup, the 400-satellite benchmark, and constellation-size comparisons.](assets/memntn_fig4.png)

The LEOPath and CARLA evaluation compares remote question-answering accuracy and end-to-end throughput across satellite constellation sizes. MemNTN achieves 97.8% QA accuracy in the 400-satellite case, outperforming the compared baselines.

## Selected Results

| Evaluation | Setting | MemCen QA accuracy |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| CARLA Town04 | Static communication conditions | **92.4%** |
| CARLA Town05 | Dynamic channels, heterogeneous UAVs, and building blockage | **84.0%** |
| PMAS  | Real aerial observations with offline channel replay | **88.5%** |

The Town05 demo shows ten virtual UAV cameras following a closed road route in a
5 × 2 layout. Captions update every three seconds. See the
[asset descriptions](assets/README.md) for recording details.
